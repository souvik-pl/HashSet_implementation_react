# HashSet implementation in React
In this project, I have implemented an HashSet class which has the following functionalities -
- `void add(data: number)`: Inserts the data into the HashSet.
- `void remove(data: number)`: Removes the data in the HashSet. If data does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.
- `boolean contains(data: number)`: Returns whether the data exists in the HashSet or not.


## Installation

- Pull this branch into your local system.
- Make sure you have Node installed (preferrably Node v18.17.1).
- Navigate to the project directory and run 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Once all the dependencies have been installed, run the following command to start the dev server.
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
